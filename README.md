# Deep Learning code reposotiry

### What does this repo contain?
This repository contains various implementations of Deep Learning techniques, such as SVMs, Auto Encoders, simple CIFAR-10 classifiers but also
Deep Reinforcement Learning implementations

### Example
For example, a Keras implementation of an SVM put right before a pre-trained AutoEncoder results
