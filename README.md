# Deep Learning code repository

### What does this repo contain?
This repository contains various implementations of Deep Learning techniques, such as SVMs, Auto Encoders, simple CIFAR-10 classifiers but also
Deep Reinforcement Learning implementations

### SVM Example
For example, a Keras implementation of an SVM put right before a pre-trained AutoEncoder results 
in the following details:

A grid search for the best (C,γ) values tells us that the best combination is somewhere near (C,γ)=(2^1, 2^-3)

Thus, a finer grid search results in (C,γ)=(2^0.5, 2^-2.75).

### Deep Reinforcement Learning 
Example to be added once tests are complete
